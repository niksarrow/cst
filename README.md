# IWSLT Conversational Fluent Translation Tast 2020
This repository contains the implementation of encoder-decoder_aux-decoder architecture adapted from facebookresearch/UnsupervisedMT. This was a submission to IWSLT 2020 Conversational Disfluency Removal Task.

## The Implementation includes:
- Autoencoder Training
- Parallel Data Training

## Noise Model Techniques for Disfluency Removal:
- Synonym Insertion
- Filler Word Insertion/Repetition
- Small Phrase Repetition
- Pronoun Phrase Repetition
- False Start
- Word Shuffle
- Word Dropout
- Random Word Insertion
- Word Blank

## Dependencies

* Python 3
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) 
* [Moses](http://www.statmt.org/moses/) (clean and tokenize text / train PBSMT model)
* [fastBPE](https://github.com/glample/fastBPE) (generate and apply BPE codes)
* [fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) (generate embeddings)
* [MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE) (generate cross-lingual embeddings)

## Data
Download data in spanish and english. Create a data directory. Create sub-directories according to get_data_esen_noise.sh and place data accordingly. 

## Data Preparation

    ./get_data_esen.sh
